# MyStuff
> The best way to share everything, to everyone.



## Safe, Secured, and Supported
> MyStuff, although a one man project (hopefully not for long) tries to overcome its limitations to the best of its ability

## Built on Trust
> MyStuff is built on trust and privilege, giving users free speech and free ability throughout our website.

### Final Note
> *MyStuff is completely free and open source, if anything or anyone says otherwise, you are being lied too, MyStuff was made to be open source as MyStuff was made for the community, not the capitalism, if you have any other questions you can contact support [here](https://mystuff.ksiscute.repl.co/support)*
